dotfiles
========

Symlink your `~/.whatever-config-file` to wherever you cloned `dotfiles/.whatever-config-file`.
You might have to reload your editor or shell configuration afterwards for the new configuration to take effect. Also, be sure to back up your original config files before overwriting or deleting them.
